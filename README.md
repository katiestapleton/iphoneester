# nostalgicServices MVP

Through the support of Skilled KC Technological Institute, we have created a website called "Nostaglic Services". As a group of three teammates, we decided to design a website for a fictional company: Nostaglic Services. The concept is a services site that offers customers a variety of services from third parties that are 1980s themed. We had four days to make this website. Though it is a MVP, we pushed outselves to keep going and improving the site. It was built starting with a template, but numerous changes were made. In my opinion, its pretty salvy for four days work with intermediate knowledge about HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap/Grid. (Still diving into JS, node, etc). Hopefully, as time permits, this website will continue to improve. Finally, I must give mutual credit to Jeremy Hatfield and Cami Taylor who are wonderous team members to work with.
